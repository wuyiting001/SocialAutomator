# SocialAutomator
SocialAutomator is a Python-based project that combines social media automation and data analysis. It provides a framework and tools to automate interactions with social media platforms, such as posting, liking, and commenting, as well as analyze social media data for insights and trends. The project aims to simplify the process of managing social media activities and extracting valuable information from social media data.

## Features

- Social media automation: Automate tasks like posting, liking, commenting, and following on popular social media platforms.
- Data collection: Collect social media data using APIs or web scraping techniques to gather information for analysis.
- Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess social media data to prepare it for analysis.
- Sentiment analysis: Analyze the sentiment of social media posts using natural language processing techniques.
- Trend analysis: Identify trends and patterns in social media data to gain insights into user behavior and preferences.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/wuyiting001/SocialAutomator.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Configure the social media platform credentials and API keys in the `config.py` file.
- Customize the automation tasks and data analysis code in the `socialautomator.py` file.

## Usage

1. Configure the social media platform credentials and API keys in the `config.py` file. Add your own credentials for the desired social media platforms.

```python
# Social media platform credentials
TWITTER_API_KEY = 'your-twitter-api-key'
TWITTER_API_SECRET = 'your-twitter-api-secret'
# ...

# Other settings
# ...
Customize the settings based on the social media platforms you want to automate.

Customize the automation tasks and data analysis code in the socialautomator.py file. Use Python libraries like Tweepy, Selenium, or Requests to interact with social media platforms and perform data analysis.

import tweepy
from config import TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET

# Authenticate with Twitter API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(TWITTER_API_KEY, TWITTER_API_SECRET)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Example task: Post a tweet
def post_tweet(message):
    api.update_status(message)

# Example task: Like tweets
def like_tweets(keyword):
    tweets = api.search(q=keyword)
    for tweet in tweets:
        api.create_favorite(tweet.id)

# Example task: Collect tweets
def collect_tweets(keyword):
    tweets = api.search(q=keyword)
    for tweet in tweets:
        # ... collect tweet data ...

# Example task: Perform sentiment analysis
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    # ... sentiment analysis logic goes here ...

# Run the automation tasks
post_tweet("Hello, Twitter!")
like_tweets("python")
collect_tweets("data analysis")
analyze_sentiment("I love this product!")

Customize the automation tasks and data analysis code based on your specific requirements and the social media platforms you want to interact with.

Run the socialautomator.py script to execute the defined tasks:

python socialautomator.py
The script will automate the defined tasks on the specified social media platforms and perform data analysis on the collected social media data.
